It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues.

There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, \u2026) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.One of R\u2019s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formula where needed.

Basically, the goal of Biopython is to make it as easy as possible to use Python for bioinformatics by creating high-quality, reusable modules and classes. Biopython features include parsers for various Bioinformatics file formats (BLAST, Clustalw, FASTA, Genbank,...), access to online services (NCBI, Expasy,...), interfaces to common and not-so-common programs (Clustalw, DSSP, MSMS...), a standard sequence class, various clustering modules, a KD tree data structure etc. and even documentation.\r\n\r\n", "source": "http://www.biopython.org", "title": "Biopython"}, "model": "instructional_assessment.content", "pk": 4}, {"fields": {"body": "HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications.
